1. CDN: Vue does not need libraries installation to work, just link to an online file in your HTML:
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.14/dist/vue.js"></script> (for prototpye)
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.14"></script> (for production)

2. Local installation: Using just Vue 2, without ANY additional libraries:

- Create a new folder and run:

  > npm install vue

- create a bioler plate HTML with <div id="app"></div> in the body
- link it to a "main.js" script

3. Using an CLI for more presets: (not finished)
   > npm i -g @vue/cli (need root permission?)
